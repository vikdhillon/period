# load the object counts versus MJD for all of the apertures on all
# three CCDs, putting the light curves in slot 1 onwards. If each
# of the three ULTRACAM CCDs has two apertures - one for the target star and
# one for the comparison star - then slots 1 to 6 will be filled as follows:
# slot 1: light curve of the target in CCD1 (red)
# slot 2: light curve of the target in CCD2 (green)
# slot 3: light curve of the target in CCD3 (blue)
# slot 4: light curve of the comparison in CCD1 (red)
# slot 5: light curve of the comparison in CCD2 (green)
# slot 6: light curve of the comparison in CCD3 (blue)

# "pl vert" makes a three-panel plot with the red light curve at
# the top, the green light curve in the middle and the blue
# light curve at the bottom.
# the "la" commands add labels to the axes.
# "dev target.ps/cps" plots the light curve to a colour postscript
# file (if this command is omitted, the plot will appear in an xwindow
# instead).
# the "win 2" and "win 3" commands move to the middle and bottom plot
# panels, respectively.
