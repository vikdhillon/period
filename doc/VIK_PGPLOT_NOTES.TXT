Installing PGPLOT on my MacBook Air, vsd@sheffield, 28 Dec 2010
---------------------------------------------------------------

This was tricky, due to the difficulty of having to 
get pgplot working within the UCAM pipeline. 
Having installed gfortran from HPC, I did the following:

1. mkdir /Users/vsd/pgplot
2. Down the latest pgplot522.tar file into this directory and expand.
This creates a directory called pgplot with everything in it. Rename it
to src, so that all of its contents are now in the directory
/Users/vsd/pgplot/src.
3. cd src and mkdir sys_macosx
4. cd to sys_macosx and "cp ../sys_linux/* ."
5. "cp g77_gcc.conf gfortran_gcc.conf"
6. Now edit gfortran_gcc.conf and make it look like the file below. This
took me ages to tweak it to be correct, especially for use with the UCAM pipeline.
7. Now cd to /Users/vsd/pgplot. Then type: cp pgplot/drivers.list .
Then edit drivers.list and comment in the gif, postscript, png, null, xs and 
xw devices.
8. Now cp /opt/local/include/png.h, pngconf.h, zlib.h, zconf.h to
/Users/vsd/pgplot. This will get the png device type working.
9. Now, still in /Users/vsd/pgplot, type the command:
$PWD/src/makemake $PWD/src macosx gfortran_gcc
10. Now type make.
11. Now type "make cpg" to make the c library
12. Now type make clean.
13. Now test everything is ok by running the pgdemo files.
14. Now update the .cshrc file as follows:

# setup pgplot. Link programs as follows: f77 program.f $pglink -o program
#
#setenv PGPLOT_DIR /Users/vsd/pgplot
#setenv PGPLOT_DEV /xs
#setenv pglink "-L/Users/vsd/pgplot -lpgplot -L/usr/X11R6/lib -X11"

That's it!

Below is the gfortran_gcc.conf file......:

# present configuration is one of many for this OS, and it needs
# different modifications to files in pgplot/sys than the other
# configurations, then you should create a subdirectory of SYSDIR,
# place the modified files in it and change the following line to

   SYSDIR="$SYSDIR"
