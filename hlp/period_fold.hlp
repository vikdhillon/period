                        Command: FOLD

BRIEF DESCRIPTION: Folds the data on a given period and zero point. 
Hence, this option transforms the data onto a phase scale, where one 
phase unit is equal to one period and phase zero is defined by the zero 
point. If the zero point is not known, the data can be folded by taking 
the first data point as the zero point. This option is useful for 
checking whether derived periods actually give sensible results when 
applied to the data. In addition to normal folding, it is also possible
to phase bin the data, which folds the data and then averages all the 
data points falling into each bin. It is also possible to plot a
user-defined number of cycles.  

PROMPT1: Enter first and last slots for input (0,0 to quit)
TYPE   : INTEGER
OPTIONS: Any pair of integers between 0 and MXSLOT
DEFAULT: None
PURPOSE: Determines the location of the data to be folded

PROMPT2: Enter first and last slots for output (0,0 to quit)
TYPE   : INTEGER
OPTIONS: Any pair of integers between 0 and MXSLOT
DEFAULT: None
PURPOSE: Determines the location of the folded data

PROMPT3: Enter period to fold data on
TYPE   : REAL*8
OPTIONS: Any real number greater than 0
DEFAULT: None
PURPOSE: Determines the period on which to fold the data on

PROMPT4: Enter zero point (0 for first data point)
TYPE   : REAL*8
OPTIONS: Any real number
DEFAULT: None
PURPOSE: Determines the zero point of the data folding

PROMPT5: Enter number of phase bins (0 for simple folding)
TYPE   : INTEGER
OPTIONS: Any integer greater than or equal to 0
DEFAULT: None
PURPOSE: Determines the number of phase bins after folding. If 0,
         the data is folded with no phase binning

PROMPT6: Enter number of cycles
TYPE   : INTEGER
OPTIONS: Any integer greater than or equal to 1
DEFAULT: None
PURPOSE: Determines the number of cycles of folded data which 
         are written to the output slot
