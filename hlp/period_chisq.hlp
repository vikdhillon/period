                        Command: CHISQ

BRIEF DESCRIPTION: This is a straight-forward technique where the input
data is folded on a series of trial periods. At each trial period, the
data is fitted with a sine curve. The resulting reduced-chi**2 values 
are plotted as a function of trial frequency and the minima in the plot 
suggest the most likely periods. This method is ideally suited to the 
study of radial velocity data or any other sinusoidal variations. Note
that windowed data cannot be processed by this option since no sine fit
is possible.
