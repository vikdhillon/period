                        Command: PDM

BRIEF DESCRIPTION: The phase dispersion minimization (PDM) technique is 
simply an automated version of the classical method of distinguishing
between possible periods, in which the period producing the least
observational scatter about the mean light curve (or, for example,
radial velocity curve) is chosen. This technique is well suited to 
cases in which only a few observations are available over a limited 
period of time, especially if the light curve is highly non-sinusoidal.
The data is first folded on a series of trial frequencies. For each 
trial frequency, the full phase interval (0,1) is divided into a 
user-specified number of bins. The width of each bin is also specified 
by the user, such that a point need not be picked (if a bin width
narrower than the bin spacing is selected) or a point can belong to more 
than one bin (if a bin width wider than the bin spacing is selected). 
The variance of each of these bins (or samples) is then calculated. This 
gives a measure of the scatter around the mean light curve defined by 
the means of the data in each sample. The PDM statistic can then be 
calculated by dividing the overall variance of all the samples by the 
variance of the original (unbinned) dataset. This process is then 
repeated for the next trial frequency. Note that windowed data cannot be 
passed to this option since its variance is zero. If the trial period is 
not a true period, then the overall sample variance will be 
approximately equal to the variance of the original dataset (ie. the PDM 
statistic will be approximately equal to 1). If the trial period is a 
correct period, the PDM statistic will reach a local minimum compared 
with neighbouring periods, hopefully near zero.
