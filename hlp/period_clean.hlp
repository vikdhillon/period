                        Command: CLEAN

BRIEF DESCRIPTION: The CLEAN algorithm was originally developed for use
in aperture synthesis and was only relatively recently applied to one-
dimensional data. The algorithm, which is particularly useful for
unequally-spaced data, basically deconvolves the spectral window from 
the discrete Fourier power spectrum (or dirty spectrum). This produces 
a CLEANed spectrum, which is largely free of the many effects of 
spectral leakage. In order to prevent small errors from destabilizing
the CLEAN procedure, the user is prompted for two parameters -- the 
loop gain and the number of iterations. Briefly, with each iteration, 
some fraction (governed by the loop gain) of the window function is 
removed from the dirty spectrum. For convergence, the loop gain must
lie between 0 and 2, typical values being between 0.1 and 1. Values
at the bottom of this range require more iterations, but should 
provide more stability. Hence, the number of iterations should be 
large if the loop gain is small, typical values lying between 1 and 
100. Note that an increase in the number of cleans produces a less 
noisy spectrum but, in general, the amplitude of the peaks is 
decreased, sometimes by a substantial amount.
