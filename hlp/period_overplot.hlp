                        Command: OVERPLOT

BRIEF DESCRIPTION: Toggles overplotting on and off. When on, multiple
slots are plotted in the same plot window. When off, PLT clears each
plot before plotting the next slot. Note that if OVERPLOT is on, it is
also possible to type "plot vertical" in PLT, which plots each slot in
its own panel.
