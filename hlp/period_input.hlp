                        PERIOD ON-LINE HELP            (VSD 1994-FEB-01)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

                        Command: INPUT

BRIEF DESCRIPTION: Loads data from ASCII files on disk into data
slots. The input files may contain up to a maximum of MXROW rows and
MXCOL columns. Data is stored and processed within PERIOD using a slot
system.  A data slot is simply an array holding one dataset. The
maximum number of data slots which can be handled at any one time is
MXSLOT. In order to load the first slot with a single dataset, you
should reply 1,1 to PROMPT1. Similarly, if you wish to load slots 4
through to 9 with 6 datasets, you should reply 4,9 to PROMPT1. Note
that slots can be overwritten. Once the slot numbers are specified,
the number of columns in the input files are determined and the user
is then prompted for which columns refer to the x-axis, y-axis and the
y-axis errors (optional). If, for example, you are inputting radial
velocity data, the x-axis should be the heliocentric Julian dates, the
y-axis should be the corresponding radial velocity values, and if you
wish errors to be taken into account, the y-axis errors should be the
errors on the radial velocity measurements. These errors are used (or
handled) by all options in the main PERIOD menu, but the only
periodicity-finding option in the PERIOD_PERIOD sub-menu which
actually uses the errors on data points is CHISQ. The remaining five
techniques (CLEAN, FT, PDM, SCARGLE, STRING) ignore errorbars if they
are present. Note also that the input file MUST contain x-axis values
which are in ascending order, otherwise INPUT will report a warning
and either sort the data (if requested to do so) or abort the input.

PROMPT1: Enter first and last slots for input (0,0 to quit)
TYPE   : INTEGER
OPTIONS: Any pair of integers between 0 and MXSLOT
DEFAULT: None
PURPOSE: Determines the location of the input data 

PROMPT2: Enter name of data file (<CR> to quit)
TYPE   : CHARACTER*72
OPTIONS: Any valid linux filename
DEFAULT: Quit INPUT and return to menu
PURPOSE: Specifies name of input ASCII file on disk

PROMPT3: Enter number of column containing X data
TYPE   : INTEGER
OPTIONS: Any integer between 1 and MXCOL
DEFAULT: None
PURPOSE: Specifies which column in the input file corresponds
         to the x-axis data. Data must be in ascending order

PROMPT4: Enter number of column containing Y data
TYPE   : INTEGER
OPTIONS: Any integer between 1 and MXCOL
DEFAULT: None
PURPOSE: Specifies which column in the input file corresponds
         to the y-axis data

PROMPT5: Are there errors on the Y axis data ? [Y]
TYPE   : CHARACTER*1
OPTIONS: Y or N
DEFAULT: Y
PURPOSE: Gives the user the option of including errors on the
         y-axis data points

PROMPT6: Enter number of column containing Y data errors
TYPE   : INTEGER
OPTIONS: Any integer between 1 and MXCOL
DEFAULT: None
PURPOSE: Specifies which column in the input file corresponds
         to the y-axis errors

PROMPT7: Does this agree with the data file ? [Y]
TYPE   : CHARACTER*1
OPTIONS: Y or N
DEFAULT: Y
PURPOSE: Allows speedy loading of data into PERIOD by
         accepting default column assignments; column 1
         = x-axis, column 2 = y-axis and column 3 = 
         y-axis errors

PROMPT8: Would you like to sort the data ? [N]
TYPE   : CHARACTER*1
OPTIONS: Y or N
DEFAULT: N
PURPOSE: INPUT has found x-axis data which is not in ascending
         order. INPUT will either sort the data or abort the
         input, depending on the response to this prompt.
